Fedora has thincrust, debian has vmbuilder, Arch Linux has varch.
Varch is used to quickly generate virtual machine images.

Varch has support for qemu, kvm and virtualbox images. Varch can also create raw, generic virtual machine images which can be ported to most virtual machine managers.

Varch also has full support for creating Libvirt images and configurations, bringing better libvirt support to Arch Linux.

For more information on Varch please consult the Arch Linux wiki:

Varch is available via the Arch Linux AUR:
